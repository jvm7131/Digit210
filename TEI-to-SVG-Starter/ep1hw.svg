               I said, if you ain't lendin' me money, then no date today. Oh, but I'd be okay if
                  you finally put out instead. You'll pay for the love hotel, though.

               You need to be punched!

                  puttin' out! Get lost!

                  Momo
                  Come on, comfort me! He was my first boyfriend.
               
               
                  Muko
                  That's why I told you to not go for him. What was so good about him,
                     anyway?
               
               
                  Momo
                  He looked like Ken Takakura. 
               
               
                  Muko
                  Oh, there you go. You're so annoying.

                  Oh, there you go. You're so annoying.
               
               
                  Momo
                  Nothing wrong with that! I like masculine guys like Ken Takakura!

                  What the hell. Will I not be able to meet another Mr. Ken in my lifetime? Come
                     on, someone comfort me! Such a cruel world.

                  How lame. Do only scum live in this world? Man, I've had enough. Where can I

                  Someone like Miss Ayase talking to me? That's gotta be the only reason!
               
               
                  Momo
                   Maybe you got the wrong idea? It's not like I wanna get chummy with you or
                     anything. Forget all that earlier.
               
               
                  Ken
                  This is what I'm talking about! 
               
               The President has already gone to Mars! What is the
                  entirety of Project Pegasus?!

                  Ken
                  You're a fan of the occult!

                  Oh, I don't believe in UFOs or aliens or stuff like that.
               
               
                  Ken
                  I'm not talking about a UFO, but a UAP! Unidentified Aerial Phenomena!
               
               
                  Momo

                  Ken
                  The U.S. military has officially acknowledged the existence of UAPs and
                     reformed the Space Force! Japan has also newly created an Aerospace
                     Self-Defense Force! Any way you look at it, they're getting ready for Space
                     Wars!
               
               
                  Momo
                  Can I go now? 
               
               
                  Ken
                  What? No, wait! This has the newest image of Nessie, too. Here! It also talks
                     about Lieutenant Colonel Jim Channon and Skinwalker Ranch!
               
               
                  Momo
                  Shut up! I just got dumped so I don't want any of this. How you push stuff at
                     me is so typical of otaku and really annoying! That's why you have no friends!
                     Don't talk to me like you know me. Sorry, that was a bit much.
               
               YOUR TRUE POWERS AND POTENTIAL HAVE YET TO
                  AWAKEN…
               
                  Momo
                   Here. I don't believe in aliens. But I do believe in ghosts.
               
               
                  Ken
                  Oh no, there's no such thing as ghosts. 
               
               
                  Momo
                  I matched the conversation topic to yours, but you outright deny that?! Don't
                     you mock the occult! Just so you know, my grandma is a spirit medium.
               
               
                  Ken
                  What? 
               
               
                  Momo
                  Have you ever seen an exorcism? It's really wicked! The possessed person goes
                     into convulsions! You can go into convulsions from illness, too.
               
               
                  Ken
                  It's not proof that ghosts are out there. 
               
               
                  Momo
                  Then have you ever had an alien let you ride a UFO?!
               
               
                  Ken
                  Your logic is jumping too far! Are you an idiot?!
               
               
                  Muko
                  Huh? She gave up on Ken Takakura and went after an otaku?
               
               
                  Miko
                  Look. It's like she doesn't care what other people would think.
               
               
                  Muko
                  Can't say I hate it. 
               
               
                  Momo
                  Then let's have a contest, dammit! If there really are ghosts, you'll be
                     serving me as a gofer!
               
               
                  Ken
                  I'll show you UFOs, I mean, UAPs! If you're able to see one, M-Miss Ayase,
                     you'll be my gofer instead!
               
         
         
            
               NAGI GENERAL HOSPITAL
               
                  Momo
                  What is this place? It's way too scary! What part of this is a UFO hotspot?
               
               
                  Ken
                  They call that Nagi Hospital a sanctuary for UFOs! If you call for a UFO on the
                     roof, you will experience an Abduction!
               
               
                  Momo
                  What's an Abduction? 
               
               
                  Ken
                  That's when an alien kidnaps you and experiments with your body.
               
               
                  Momo
                   Wait, hold on! Have you been experimented on before?!
               
               
                  Ken
                  There is a chance that I have! 
               
               
                  Momo
                  Huh? 
               
               
                  Ken
                  Many people who experience an Abduction have their memories erased.
               
               
                  Momo
                  Hey, you. You've never seen a UFO before, have you?
               
               
                  Ken
                  Do you know about regressive hypnosis? 
               
               
                  Momo
                  Don't change the subject on me. 
               
               
                  Ken
                  It's not an issue of whether or not you've seen one! The point is whether or
                     not there's proper proof that they exist! 
               
               
                  Momo
                  Shut up! Anyway, how are things on your end?
               
            
               KEEP OUT 
               
                  Ken
                  I have arrived. At the spiritual hotspot. Now, I'll go and prove it right now…
                     that there are no such things as ghosts!
               
               
                  Momo
                  Hey, you aren't freaking out, are you? By the way, that spot is famous on the
                     'net for something definitely being there.
               
               
                  Ken
                  Too shy, shy boy, in this moment! 
               
               
                  Momo
                  They say speaking loudly is the most dangerous thing to do.

                  Ken
                  You've been mentioning the 'net a lot. So have you seen a ghost, Miss
                     Ayase?
               
            
               
                  Momo
                  Nope. 
               
               
                  Ken
                  What? How dare you talk so authoritatively earlier!
               
               
                  Momo
                  My bad! 
               
               
                  Ken
                  Take back that attitude you've been giving me! It's absurd that you've never
                     seen a ghost but believe in them!
               
               
                  Momo
                  It's not absurd. I told you my grandma's a spirit medium. I love my grandma a
                     lot since I don't have parents.
               
               
                  Ken
                  Oh, I see. 
               
               
                  Momo
                  Why are you getting all meek and stuff? Get a load of this. My family is
                     seriously weird.
               
            
                  Momo
                   I always had to perform a good luck ritual before stepping outside. I was
                     always forced to do it the entire way to school. And of course, I was the
                     laughingstock of all the boys. If I don't do it, Grandma got pissed. It was the
                     pits. But the toughest part of it all… was when the boy I liked made fun of me.
                     I really hated my grandma. "Because of that weird ritual, the boy I like hates
                     me." I think I said something horrible like that to Grandma.

                  Since then, I didn't talk to Grandma until recently, and I stopped doing the
                     ritual. But you know, I get pissed when someone else makes fun of my family.
                     That's when I realized…
               
            
                  Momo
                  I didn't hate the fact that the boy I liked didn't like me. I hated the fact
                     that the boy I liked made fun of my grandma. In reality, I loved both Grandma
                     and her job as a spirit medium, because it felt special. How she decided to
                     take me in, and lovingly raised me all by herself… I have faith in my
                     grandma.
               
            
               
                  Momo
                   That's why I believe in ghosts. So anyway, why do you believe in aliens?
               
            
               
                  Ken
                  That really doesn't matter, right? 
               
            
            
               
                  Momo
                  What's with that? You don't have any reasons? Do you need a reason to like
                     something? Well, you have a point. More like, Occult-kun, you sure talk bluntly
                     over the phone.

                  -They say on the 'net she's bad news! 
               
               
                  Ken
                  I'm pretty sure I misunderstood something. I simply bumped into a lewd
                     granny!
               
               
                  Momo
                   They say you can't let her outrun you at any cost! If you lose a race against
                     Turbo Granny, you'll be cursed! Hey, Occult-kun! Are you listening? Hello?
                     Answer me! You're kidding me, right?
               
            
                  Momo
                   I'll head over there right now! Just hang on! What are those things?

                  I'll give it to you! Anything if it's mine! I've been wanting to see aliens for
                     the longest time! Because I didn't have any friends, I thought at least aliens
                     would be my friends. I've been calling to the skies for a UFO since grade
                     school! But you never came! No matter how much I called for you, you never
                     showed up! Other humans bullied me to pass their time. Aliens didn't give me
                     the time of day. Nobody ever acknowledged my existence. But Miss Ayase…. She
                     actually stood up for me, despite that! So don't you lay a finger on her! I
                     won't allow anyone to hurt her! If it's for her sake, I'll even become a
                     monster!

                  You have to beat the crap out of Turbo Granny. She's the cause of the
                     curse.
               
               
                  Ken
                  I see. Then I'll head on over there. 
               
               
                  Momo
                  Huh? Right now? 
               
               
                  Ken
                  Miss Ayase, please wear my clothes back home.
               
               
                  Momo
                  Hold on! You'll lose control without me! 
               
               
                  Ken
                  All of this happened because of what I did. I can't get you involved in it
                     anymore, Miss Ayase. I'll use willpower to make it to the tunnel, and then make
                     it work somehow.
               
               
                  Momo
                  Why can't you ask me to come with you? After that experience earlier, I can't
                     leave you alone! You would've died earlier if I wasn't around!
               
               
                  Ken
                   Is it okay for you to help someone like me?
               
               
                  Momo
                  Stuff like that is such a hassle. Come on, put some clothes on. Let's go! 
               
               
                  Ken
                  I'm sorry. I am an awkward fellow, after all. Miss Ayase, please put some
                     clothes on. If you don't, I can't bring myself to speak properly.
               
               
                  Momo
                   No way. Why is my heart racing? This can't be. I was just surprised because he
                     happened to recite one of Ken Takakura's lines. I need to calm down for now. By
                     the way, what's your name? I'm terrible at remembering names. Oh? Um…
               
               
                  Ken
                  I'm Ken Takakura. 
               
               
                  Momo
                  Aliens really did exist! 
               
               
                  Ken
                  Ghosts exist, too! The existence of aliens and ghosts being proven means that
                     there's a possibility of supernatural phenomena, UMA, and all other things that
                     were said to be absurd can be proven as well.
               
               
                  Momo
                  Oh, fine, I get it! Ready.
